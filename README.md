### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I am a software engineer with a specialization in developing enterprise-grade, high-performance, and distributed software systems. Over the years, I’ve worked across industries like FinTech and Blockchain, where I’ve designed services that support millions of users, improved internal platforms for operations teams, and created tools that help dev teams ship faster and more efficiently.

I work primarily with the Go and JavaScript/TypeScript programming languages, and I also have some experience with Python.

You can follow me on Twitter [@the_code_genin](https://twitter.com/the_code_genin)! I post informative stuff there from time to time... and why not?😄
