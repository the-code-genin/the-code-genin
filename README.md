### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I’m a software engineer with a core specialization in building server-side software and distributed systems. With over 6 years of industry experience, I’ve worked across multiple FinTech domains, including cross-border remittances, decentralized finance (blockchain), and embedded financial products, as well as on ERP, CRM, and SaaS platforms serving businesses and individuals.

My work has supported systems used by millions of users, improved operational efficiency for internal teams, and enabled engineering teams to ship reliable features faster at scale.

I primarily work with Go and JavaScript/TypeScript, with working experience in Python, and I’m particularly interested in building systems that are reliable, observable, and easy to operate in production.

You can follow me on Twitter [@the_code_genin](https://twitter.com/the_code_genin)! I post informative stuff there from time to time... and why not?😄
